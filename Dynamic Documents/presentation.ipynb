    "## Before We Begin\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Special thanks to Oscar Barriga Cabanillas for helping out today\n",
    "-   Thank you for BITSS for organizing\n",
    "-   How has it been so far?\n",
    "-   A Question:\n",
    "    -   How familiar are you with python? Jupyter?\n",
    "    -   What are you thinking of getting out of this talk?\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to watch this presentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Either:\n",
    "    -   `git clone` the repository\n",
    "    -   Start up jupyter lab\n",
    "    -   open `presentation.ipynb`\n",
    "    -   follow along\n",
    "-   Or:\n",
    "    -   Go to the repository and press the `Launch Binder` Button\n",
    "    -   To be explained later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Dynamic Documents?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Documents are a part of the bigger picture of Reproducible Science. Sure, there is a fixed cost; **BUT**, they make my life easier in these ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Short term: Easier to document fresh out of the oven results\n",
    "-   Medium term: Fast, reliable and tractable new results\n",
    "-   Long term: You can see how everything was created\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Dynamic Documents?\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on principles of literate programming, we aim at combining code and paper in one single document\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Best framework to achieve the holy grail of one-click reproducible workflow\n",
    "-   Best two current implementations: RMarkdown (R) & Jupyter (Python).\n",
    "-   Stata is catching up: We will come back to this in a second\n",
    "\n",
    "## The State of Things Now\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the code and the narrative components live in separate universes\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/flow_3.png\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part of Larger Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Dynamic documents are best used as part of a larger organized workflow\n",
    "    -   Structuring folders: Data, analysis, output\n",
    "    -   Documenting code\n",
    "    -   Combining both into a final document: Pre analysis or final paper\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markdown's Entrance\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In terms of writing the \"paper\"/documentation part of dynamic documents, there are many solutions\n",
    "    -   Latex, HTML, RST (ReStructured Text)\n",
    "-   But most have honed in on using Markdown\n",
    "    -   Markdown is an easy way to write formatted text in a plain text format\n",
    "    -   But without as verbose and difficult of a syntax like latex/HTML\n",
    "-   Although basic markdown has the basics for formatting, creating tables, adding figures\n",
    "-   We will use Pandoc, which is used in both the Stata and R sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markdown Cheatsheet\n",
    "\n",
    "There are loads of markdown cheatsheats on the web. One can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)\n",

    "## What is Pandoc?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Pandoc is sort of what it says: pan (all), doc (document)\n",
    "-   It's a way to convert between and across different file formats\n",
    "    -   Word -\\> HTML\n",
    "    -   Latex -\\> Markdown\n",
    "    -   HTML -\\> XML\n",
    "    -   Anything to anything\n",
    "-   See Pandoc's [website](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#options) for all input and output filetypes\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Magic of Pandoc\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Pandoc and Markdown allows you to create one file that can then be used in many different places\n",
    "-   Example:\n",
    "    -   You're writing your CV and want to put it up in various places.\n",
    "    -   Your website needs HTML\n",
    "    -   One job posting allows PDF\n",
    "    -   One job posting only allows Word\n",
    "-   Ordinarily, you would need to have three versions, Word, HTML, PDF\n",
    "    -   This might get unruly as you change one but forget to change the other\n",
    "    -   What if there's another file format you might need?\n",
    "-   With Pandoc and markdown, you would:\n",
    "    -   write your CV in markdown\n",
    "    -   convert to PDF, Word and PDF with pandoc\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A way to do literate programming and dynamic documents\n",
    "-   Provide code and writing/analysis, on a language agnostic platform\n",
    "    -   Meaning that it is not restricted to just one language\n",
    "    -   Currently there are so-called kernels for many languages\n",
    "    -   Including Stata, Python, R, C, Golang, C++, Fortran and more coming!\n",
    "-   Uses the power of Markdown/Latex Math and Code to tell a story and provide an efficient workflow\n",
    "-   Convert into several different formats including Latex, HTML, Presentations etc...\n",
    "-   The Jupyter server is also available in other text editors such as Atom and VS Code.\n",
    "-   And now available in STATA!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Under the Hood\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You can think of Jupyter as broadly being made up of two parts:\n",
    "    -   A JSON document that organizes text between markdown, code, figures, widgets, etc...\n",
    "    -   A server that loads a \"kernel\" with a particular language and knows how to translate the markdown to formatted text and the code to execution\n",
    "    -   A web interface (although not required)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/DeepinScreenshot_select-area_20190107171714.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Jupyter is ubiquitous\n",
    "-   Jupyter is used by basically all of the data science community\n",
    "-   Jupyter is used by other software (VS Code, Atom/Hydrogen)\n",
    "-   Since Jupyter is a JSON document and built using web tools, anything that uses webtools can use it\n",
    "-   Science and publishing is changing (PDFs are becoming old, open access and web journals are becoming more popular)\n",
    "    -   Present results in a dynamic way\n",
    "    -   Interactive\n",
    "    -   More efficient to show quick interactive widget to experiment with colleagues/advisors than 50 figures in a static PDF\n",
